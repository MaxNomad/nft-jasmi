Her collection of works conveys a complex multifaceted plot. She wants each viewer to find a plot that resonates with their inner world and the search for their true self. The intricacy of each detail, perspective, colour, image, and composition will draw you into the artist's creative world. The interplay of light and shadow. The merging of seemingly unrelated worlds. The true meaning is hidden in the depth that each person should discover on their own.</p>
